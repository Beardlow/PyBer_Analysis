# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview

  The purpose of this analysis was to create visualizations that will allow PyBer executives to view data from a few different city types
  at a single time. The following visualizations are split between Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types.

## Results

  The conglomerated results of this data analysis show several important facts. One of the facts shown is that, for the timeframe of the
  provided .csv file, the Urban cities are using far more of our ride hails than the other two city types. Suburban and Rural are second and third, respectively. The Urban cities also have far more many drivers than the other two types of cities. The total fares collected are over twice as high for Urban cities than it is for Suburban cities. 
    The avrerage fare per ride and average fare per driver tell a very different story.  The Rural cities have the highest fare per ride and the highest fare per driver metrics.

  As we can see in the above chart, Urban cities account for the highest portion of our overall collected fares. Urban is followed by Suburban, then Rural cities, in overall fares collected. 
   The disparity between fares per driver and fares per trip averages, by city type, can be addressed by adding more drivers to the Rural and Suburban city types; however, the market is probably close to saturated in the Rural markets due to population size. More information may be needed in order to see how available more ride market share capture would be in these markets. The disparity could also be addressed by implementing a minimum fare cost per ride. This will provide a baseline where all rides would start and then the mileage and other determining cost factors could be included to bridge the gap. If the lowest absolute avergae cost could be determined, this value could become the baseline.
    The results of this analysis are somewhat expected. As you have more drivers in a city, the cost of a ride goes down. As fewer drivers are in a city, the average fare cost goes up. Tampering with this existing cost structure could cause unintended shifts towards other ride hailing services or methods.
